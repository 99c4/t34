# Editing/Syntax

This site is has been built with the help of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) for CSS/JS heavy-lifting and [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for templating and DRY development. HUGO must be installed locally in order to adequately preview development via terminal command [hugo server]. Partials/repeated components can be be found in layouts/partials. Each HTML page (layouts/page) must have a corresponding Markdown file in the Content folder (content/).

# Creating a New Page

1. Create a new HTML file in layouts/page
2. Define the content section via `{{ define "main" }}` prior to proposed content area, and {{ end }} after proposed content area. User this HTML file to affect layout and styling. Content may be added via the corresponding .md file (see step 3)
3. Create an `.md` file in the 'Content' folder and provide the appropriate metadata. Example:

```yaml
title: "White Paper"           # (How this page will appear in the menu)
Description: "tea.white paper" # (Populates as page title)
layout: "white-paper"          # (the associated HTML file)
menu: main                     # (Assign a menu)
weight: 7                      # (Order in which this item will appear)
```

Following that, begin typing content. This will populate in the section of your HTML document that has been defined as `main`.

4. If adding a menu link for an external source or ID, edit the config.toml accordingly.
5. Run with `hugo serve --watch -D`.

# Editing Partials/Repeated components

Partials may be edited in plain HTML. No additional HUGO syntax is required.

# Defining Partial Locations

Partials are defined via the `baseof.html` file in `layouts/default`. This informs the layout of a newly generated page. Insert new partials via the syntax `{{- partial "partial.html" -}}`.
