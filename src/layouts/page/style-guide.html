        <h1>The tea style guide. Also, this is an H1.</h1>
        <h2>We believe in open-sourcing everything... right down to our brand's look and feel. Also, this is an H2.</h2>
        <h3>Working with a visible grid system in a responsive framework is difficult, but you can inspect these elements to see how we did it.</h3>
        <h4>This H4 is intended to explain how we convert 'px' meaurements from design specs to 'vw' units. The formula for that is (vw = pixels / viewport total width x 100).</h4>
        <h5>This is an H5, and it's primarily used for things like the headers inside the footer section. It's a small one, but should still always be in our primary tea'l color.</h5>
        <p class="lead">This is our 'lead' text and it's displays slightly larger than our regular paragraph text. This variant is used for sub-heads and important 'call-out' information. Each line's height should be equivalent to roughly 1/3 the height of a grid box.</p>
        <p>And this is our good old-fashioned body copy. This font-size is on the larger end of what's considered standard for paragraph text. The monospace typeaces we're using, while super-cool, are not quite as ledgible as their variable-spaced counterparts. Thusly, we're over-compensating slightly. This variant, as well as the 'lead' text, should either be white (#fff) or 'Soft Black' (#1A1A1A)... depending on the background.</p>
